To model the system dynamics, I followed this lecture:

For simulation, I used selected tutorials from Steve Brunton's Control Bootcamp playlist:

Furthermore, I followed this insightful page provided through the collaborative efforts of the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Detroit Mercy. It offers clear notes on equation derivations, controller design, and helpful tutorials on MATLAB, Simulink, and Simscape. They have many projects other than the inverted pendulum, such as cruise control, motor speed and position control, ball and beam control, etc.

Disclaimer: You are free to use the code and modify it as needed for your personal learning, as I myself obtained the code from these resources and customized it for my project. Happy learning! :)
